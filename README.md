# ðŸ§  ysk_quantlib

`ysk_quantlib` is a custom quantitative finance library built by Yassine Housseine for research, learning, and prototyping in derivatives pricing, risk management, and time series modeling. It's more of student project than a real library, used essentially for my own projects.

It includes tools for:

- Option pricing (Black-Scholes, Heston, Binomial Trees)
- Greeks computation
- Delta hedging simulation
- Volatility estimation
- Stationarity and cointegration tests
